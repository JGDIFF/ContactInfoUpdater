### Introduction

### Prerequisites
Qlogin is desgined to be run on company machines that are running on a single dynamic network, however the program will still function on any personal machine, but you may not be able to use all of its features. 

You will need:
A computer
A working internet connection. 
A windows computer (No macOS support)

### Installation
In a sense, the installation process itself is the entire program, as Qlogin is an information collection tool, it should only be run upon registration, important contact information update (i.e an employee moves or changes names) or once every six months just to confirm your already existing information.

Simply unpack the .exe and run the program, the first two screens you will be presented with are:
